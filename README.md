# Play Blackjack!

## A Blackjack simulator written in C++

The purpose of this project was to implement the game Blackjack for homework assignment #2 of Object-Oriented Programming 2024, NTPU CSIE.

A practical application of breaking a program into bit-sized problems, which allowed me to gain a better understanding of the fundamental concepts of OOP.

## Game setup
* /# players: 2~4
* enter /# rounds you wish to play
* card total was calculated to the player's advantage
* players would be counted as out if they had a balance less than the minimum bet
* also, if there were less than two players left in the game with rounds remaining, the game automatically terminated and the final result would be printed
